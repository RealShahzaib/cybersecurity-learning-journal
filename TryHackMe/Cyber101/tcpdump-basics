# Tcpdump Writeup (Deep Understanding Notes)

## What is Tcpdump?

Tcpdump is a command-line packet analyzer used to capture and inspect network traffic in real time.  
It allows us to see what packets are traveling through a network interface and understand what is happening behind the scenes at the network level.

It is commonly used in:
- Network troubleshooting
- Cybersecurity analysis
- SOC investigations
- Packet-level debugging

## Why Tcpdump is Important (Conceptual View)

Before learning tcpdump, I realized that normally we use tools like:
- Browser
- Ping
- Nmap
- Applications

But we never actually SEE the packets being sent and received.

Tcpdump solves that by showing:
- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Protocol used (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Ports
- Packet flags
- Payload info (if allowed)

So instead of guessing network behavior, we observe actual traffic.

## Root Privileges Requirement (Very Important)

Tcpdump requires root/sudo privileges because:
- It captures raw packets directly from the network interface
- This is a low-level operation
- Normal users do not have permission to access raw sockets

Without sudo:
- Packet capture will fail or be limited

Example:
```bash
sudo tcpdump
